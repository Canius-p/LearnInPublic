TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It's a superset of JavaScript, which means all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript adds optional static typing and other features on top of JavaScript.

The main goal of TypeScript is to make it easier to write and maintain large-scale JavaScript applications by providing tools for catching errors before runtime through static type checking. This can help improve code quality, readability, and maintainability, especially in complex projects.
